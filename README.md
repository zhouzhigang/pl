# Programming Language
Programming Language Theory, Pratice

## Introduction

### Why should we learn different programming languages?

There are many programming language paradigms. every language has its advantages and disadvantages on different scenarios.

In order to expand our version and learn different ways of thinking, we had better learn at least one language for each paradigm.

* Process-Oriented: C
* Object-Oritented: C++, Java, C#
* Functional: Schema, Common Lisp
* Dynamic lanauges: Perl, Python, Ruby

> It's best, actually, to learn all five of Python, C/C++, Java, Perl, and LISP. Besides being the most important hacking languages, they represent very different approaches to programming, and each will educate you in valuable ways. - [How To Become A Hacker by Eric Steven Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html)

Note: Learning the basic grammar of one language maybe just need one day or two days, but learning related framework and libraries might take a long time.

### How to learn a language?

1. Decide/choose what to learn?(solve one specific problem or learn something from that language)
2. Choose resources(Offical ducuments, tutorials, books)
3. Define a learning path. An example:
    * Basic syntax, such as data types, operations, and print funcitons
    * String manupulation, search, replace, and truncate etc. Regex processing(regex and parser)
    * Other data structures like Arrays, Collections(Generics)
    * Basic object-oriented or functional features, such as inheritance, polymophism and lambda function
    * Exception, error handling, assertions, logging, degbugging, and Unit Test etc.
    * Input and output, Serilization and Deserilization
    * Event-driveing programming model. How callback method calls?
    * Thread, concurrent, asynchronous invocation mechanism
    * Dynamic Programming, Reflection and meta programming, Compile and runtime mechanism
    * Futures in this programming language, language idoms and patterns
4. Leran in practice(exercises or projects)
